# Serves the built site as an immutable image, deployed to k3s by ArgoCD
# (deploy-gtfs-rt). Expects `dist/` to exist: run `pnpm build` first, which is
# what CI does before calling docker build.
#
# Only the SPA is served here. `/api/*` on the same hostname is routed to
# cafe-car by Traefik, so this image never proxies anything itself.
#
# nginx-unprivileged listens on :8080 as uid 101 and never needs root, so the
# pod can run with runAsNonRoot + readOnlyRootFilesystem.
