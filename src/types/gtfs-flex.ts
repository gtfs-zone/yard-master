   - Types only. `stopTimeRef` and `isFlexStopTime` are dropped along with the
     `StopTimes` entity import: test-track ingests stop_times into its own
     `StopTime` model and builds refs in `gtfs-static-route-source.ts`. */

 * GTFS Flex (on-demand service) shared types and helpers.

 * A stop_time references exactly one of stop_id, location_group_id or
 * location_id. StopTimeRef is the generalized form of that reference so the
 * sequence and timetable pipelines do not have to assume stop_id.
