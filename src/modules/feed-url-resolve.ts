 * Turning what someone typed into a URL that can actually be fetched.
 *
 * Three jobs, deliberately kept apart from `feed-selection.ts` so the proxy
 * rules there stay readable:
 *
 * 1. `RT_BASE` — a feed URL may be stored as a bare path (`/amtrak/
 *    vehicle_positions.pb`). That form is environment-agnostic, so a shared link
 *    works for whoever opens it. Resolution happens at fetch time only; the
 *    selection and the hash keep the path.
 * 2. `normalizeFeedUrl` — accept the shapes people actually type.
 * 3. `isLocalUrl` — the CORS proxy lives on the public internet and cannot reach
 *    the user's own machine, so a local URL must never be routed through it.

 * never sees, and it round-trips through the share hash unharmed (a `#` inside
 * a param value is encoded as `%23`).
