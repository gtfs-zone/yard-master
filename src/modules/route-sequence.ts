/**
 * The canonical stop order for one direction of one route, plus the mapping
 * that puts any individual trip back onto it.
 *
 * A route is served by many trips whose stop lists disagree — short turns,
 * express runs, seasonal deviations. The strip needs one ordered list that
 * contains all of them.
 *
 * The order comes from a topological sort of the stop precedence graph: every
 * pattern asserts "A before B" for each consecutive pair, and any topological
 * order of those assertions contains every pattern as a subsequence, with each
 * stop appearing exactly once. The obvious alternative — folding the vendored
 * pairwise shortest-common-supersequence DP over the patterns — cannot promise
 * that, and on a real feed it does not deliver it: across the MBTA's 730
 * route/directions the fold emits duplicate stops on 14 of them, worst on the
 * Framingham/Worcester line, where six stations appear twice with the entire
 * route between the copies.
 *
 * The fold is still here, for the routes the sort cannot handle. A direction
 * whose patterns run opposite ways is a genuine cycle — the Winthrop ferry is
 * one — so no topological order exists and Kahn's algorithm stalls. Those
 * routes fall back to the fold, one route at a time and never globally; across
 * the same feed that is 5 of the 730.
 *
 * Every pattern is included, however few trips it carries. A route's rare
 * patterns are not noise — on Amtrak's Northeast Regional they are the trains
 * continuing past Washington to Norfolk, a real part of the route. Capping
 * them dropped both those stops and the ability to place any vehicle running
 * them. On the fallback path the cost of admitting them is kept down by
 * folding only patterns that actually add stops: one containment walk rejects
 * the rest in linear time.

 * comes out in two columns.
 *

 * each pattern to the base by longest common subsequence of the bare

 * take the visit index from whichever base element it matched. Elements that
