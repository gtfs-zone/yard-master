/**
 * Timezone policy for everything the app prints as a *transit* time.
 *
 * A GTFS feed describes a place, and every time in it is anchored to that
 * place's clock: `stop_times.txt` holds bare agency-local strings with no zone
 * at all, and GTFS-RT holds absolute epoch seconds. Render the first verbatim
 * and the second in the browser's zone — which is what this app used to do —
 * and the two columns silently disagree by the offset between the reader and
 * the railroad. Reading an Amtrak feed from Copenhagen showed a 09:30 schedule
 * against a "03:30 PM" prediction, both correct, six hours apart, with the
 * delay column cheerfully reporting "on time".
 *
 * So: one display zone, taken from `agency.txt`, applied to both columns.
 *
 * The zone lives in module state rather than being threaded through every
 * formatter because exactly one scheduled feed is loaded at a time — the session
 * owns a single `scheduledFeed` — and the alternative is an extra argument on
 * every call site of every time formatter on every page.
