 * Modal Router
 *

 * open. Every routed content modal (shapes, calendar, fares, on-demand, feed
 * data, levels) is opened through here, so the hash stays truthful whichever
 * way the modal was closed: its Close button, Escape, the X, the backdrop, or
 * a back/forward step in the browser.
 *
 * Modal modules are unchanged: they still call `showModal` themselves and know
 * nothing about the hash. The router opens one by calling the opener registered
 * for its type, and closes one by taking the modal stack back down to the depth
 * it had before that opener ran.
