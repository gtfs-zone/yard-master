   @status modified
   @changes
   - Fed from the in-memory `GTFSStatic` model instead of `GTFSParser` /
     IndexedDB; no async, no coord resolver, no `onStopsDataUpdated` hook.
   - Dropped pathways, levels, the Tutte coord embedding, `stops-highlight` /
     `trip-highlight`, the editing affordances, and file-highlight mode.
   - Absorbed the route layer stack from coloring-book's `route-renderer.ts`
     (casing / line / clickarea, `zoomWidth`, `applySpotlight`), rebuilt as one
     MultiLineString feature per route with `promoteId: 'route_id'` rather than
     one feature per distinct geometry.
   - `getCasingColor` is no longer local: both repos now import `casingColor`
     from the vendored `utils/route-colors.ts`.
   - Added the realtime `vehicles` stack, which has no upstream equivalent.
   - Added `rebuild()`, called after a basemap change re-creates the style.
   - Route layers are sorted by a `sortKey` feature property (see
     `route-sort.ts`); `applySpotlight` lifts the focused route above it.
   - Stop paint comes from the vendored `stop-layer-style.ts`.
   - Took the theme-aware accent from `f7084c5`: the accent resolves from
     `--color-primary` through the vendored `theme-color.ts` and repaints on
     `refreshAccentColor()`, replacing the hardcoded red. The rest of that
     commit is pathways, station hulls and map icons, none of which exist here.
   - Skipped `69dd3f6` (timetable stop focus), `1dbef88` / `63af1c9` /
     `26b87e2` (GTFS Flex zones and location groups) and `c48eede` / `b5e30d1`
     (transfer edges and table-row hover): test-track ingests none of that
     data. */
