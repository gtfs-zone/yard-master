/* @vendored-from test-track:src/modules/layer-manager.ts
   @sha bac60b6
   @status adopted
   Taken over here, as test-track took its own copy over in `868909e`. Re-synced
   against that rewrite: the shared half is now `interlocking`'s
   `layer-specs.ts` and `stop-layer-style.ts`, and what is left is this app's
   own sources and
   what fills them.

   What still diverges, and why:
   - A vehicle feature carries `tracker_id` beside `vehicle_id`, and a vehicle
     hit returns it as `FocusTarget.trackerId`. `vehicle_id` is cafe-car's
     composite key, which addresses no tracker; the surrogate is what a page and
     an API call are keyed by. */
/* @vendored-from coloring-book:src/modules/layer-manager.ts
   @sha 0d38e50
   @status adopted
   Promoted from `modified` in Phase 8. The shared half of this file is now
   `interlocking`'s `layer-specs.ts` (source ids, layer ids, filters, zoom ramps, fade
   bands, spotlight expressions) and `stop-layer-style.ts` (how one stop circle
   looks). What is left is this app's own half: which sources exist and what
   fills them. Upstream's remaining manager is the editor's, built on
   `GTFSParser` / IndexedDB with pathways, levels, flex zones, transfers and the
   editing affordances; re-syncing against it has stopped being meaningful, so
   the row is `adopted` and only the two spec files are checked.

   Deliberately not taken from upstream, with reasons:
   - Pathways, levels, the Tutte coord embedding for coord-less child stops,
     `stops-highlight` / `trip-highlight`, the editing affordances and
     file-highlight mode: no editor here.
   - `1dbef88` / `63af1c9` / `26b87e2` (flex zones and location groups),
     `c48eede` / `b5e30d1` / `8303357` / `dc1d421`'s transfer-edge half,
     `1528c8d` / `5b61f37` (shapes and zones via geojson.io): test-track
     ingests none of that data.
   - `69dd3f6` / `34a2750` (timetable stop focus): no timetable here.
   - The camera-ease-to-new-stop half of `7e77889`: no flow here creates a stop.

   Taken from upstream: `aff09db` (the gentler station fade band), `7e77889`
   (the small-feed fade exemption, which is the same change this repo already
   carried from `424cbdf`), `dc1d421`'s hovered-stop highlight, `767ac02`'s
   deduped focused expression, and `cef96c7`'s direction arrows on the single
   spotlighted route, which is what gives `interlocking`'s `map-icons.ts` a caller. */
