/**
 * The branch structure of a route strip: which lane each stop sits in, and
 * where lanes split and rejoin.
 *
 * The graph this needs is already computed and discarded by `route-sequence`.
 * `patternPositions` gives, per stop pattern, the ascending strip positions it
 * occupies; consecutive pairs, deduped across patterns, are the DAG. So there
 * is no ordering algorithm here — only classification and a lane sweep.
 *
 * The classification is the whole point. Drawing every edge as a lane is
 * unreadable: on a route where each trip skips a different subset, most edges
 * are stopping policy, not geography. An express that skips three stops and
 * rejoins the same line is a *bypass* — the line it rejoins is already drawn,
 * so the skip needs no lane of its own. A skip with no alternate path is a
 * genuine *branch*, and that is what earns a lane.
 *
 * The result: the Red Line's Ashmont/Braintree split gets two lanes below
 * JFK/UMass, while Framingham/Worcester — nineteen patterns of short turns and
 * express runs, every one of them a subsequence of the full run — stays a
 * single column, exactly as it looks today.
