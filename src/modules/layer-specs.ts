/**
 * The map's layer specification: source ids, layer ids, filters, zoom ramps
 * and the feature-state expressions that drive the stop fade and the route
 * spotlight.
 *
 * Companion to `stop-layer-style.ts`, which owns how one stop circle looks.
 * This file owns everything around it: which stops are drawn at which zoom,
 * how the hit area tracks the fade, and how wide a route line is.
 *
 * Pure builders only - no DOM, no map handle, no `this`, no app types, no
 * CONFIG. Every tunable comes in as an argument, because each app resolves
 * them differently: the set of feature states that exempt a stop from the
 * fade is not the same in an editor and in a viewer, and the fade zooms live
 * in each app's own config. Callers own `addSource`, `addLayer`, the layer
 * order, and what fills the sources.
